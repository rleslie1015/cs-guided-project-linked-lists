"""
Given a reference to the head node of a singly-linked list, write a function
that reverses the linked list in place. The function should return the new head
of the reversed list.
​
In order to do this in O(1) space (in-place), you cannot make a new list, you
need to use the existing nodes.
​
In order to do this in O(n) time, you should only have to traverse the list
once.
​
*Note: If you get stuck, try drawing a picture of a small linked list and
running your function by hand. Does it actually work? Also, don't forget to
consider edge cases (like a list with only 1 or 0 elements).*
