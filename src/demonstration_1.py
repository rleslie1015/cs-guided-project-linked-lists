"""
Given only a reference to a specific node in a linked list, delete that node from a singly-linked list.
​
Example:
​
The code below should first construct a linked list (x -> y -> z) and then delete `y` from the linked list by calling the function `delete_node`. It is your job to write the `delete_node` function.
​
```python
class LinkedListNode():
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None
​
x = LinkedListNode('X')
y = LinkedListNode('Y')
z = LinkedListNode('Z')
​
x.next = y
y.next = z
​
delete_node(y)
```
​
*Note: We can do this in O(1) time and space! But be aware that our solution will have some side effects...*
